#Introduction

Hi! This is a web-based accounting system where it makes it possible for entrepreneurs to maintain their books online which would reduce their storage space as well as accuracy of calculations. In this little document, you will find some interesting things about this project. We hope that you will like our project!

#Features of the System

In this system, we have some decent features which we are proud to brag of including:

- Multi-User System
- User Utilities (Change Password, Logout)
- Account and Transactions System.
- Generating of Trial Balance with a single click.
- Advanced security for sensitive data like users passwords, etc.
- Advanced security to avoid SQL Injections.
- Advanced security to avoid CSRF attacks making this system safer.
- Maintainable clean and tidy code and much more!

#Why should I choose this system over the other systems?

On one hand, our system focuses on security of data, which is the most valuable resource of a company while on the other, it focuses on providing fast, smooth and user friendly functionality. Let's assume that you have reached the month end, and you want to see if your trial balance balances or not. It's a piece of cake! All you have to do is goto the menu, and click the "Generate a Trial Balance" option and it will do it for you within a second which saves a lot of time. Our system mainly focuses on saving time as "Time is Money" and it should be used wisely.

However, you might say that this system lacks a lot of features. True! But our system focuses mainly on sole proprietors or small businesses where they cannot afford to pay for an account or at least cannot afford to pay for an extremely complex system worth millions of rupees! Furthermore, if you think we still lack any features, feel free to visit our GitHub repository (link in the contact us page) and drop a pull request/issue and we will implement that idea. Still, if you want to argue that our functionality is limited, it is because we have limited knowledge in this subject but if we had some sort of a qualification in this subject, we would have done a really advanced system. We carried out a lot of research and then we deleted some features which we were going to implement as computers are not in the era of "Artificial Intelligence" yet.

#How do I use this system?

It's a piece of cake! All you have to do is setup all the files in a folder, download composer.phar online and drop that file in the folder. Next, locate the folder with the Terminal and run the command "composer.phar install" and it should install all the libraries used in the system. The next step is to open up your MySQL database and import the database.sql file in the root folder. Once you are done with that, locate the 'Configuration.php' file in the 'src/' folder and edit it accordingly. Once you are done, login with the username 'Admin' and password 'changeme' and also, please make sure that you change your password immediately. Once all these steps are followed, you are ready to use the system! This would hardly take you 15 minutes.
